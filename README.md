## Key Topics Covered

Capstone project from The Odin Project, providing the opportunity to implement everything learned through the Ruby section of the curriculum.

Beyond the more technical aspects, this project provided the opportunity to get experience working with and solving a broadly scoped problem (final project did not provide any details on implementation). As such, I was required to think through the problem and implementation, maintain a disciplined workflow (utilizing git to safely experiment), stay organized, and break the problem down into workable components.
